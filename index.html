        The Kepler Space Telescope was a vital piece of technology to allow scientists to observe planets we previously wouldn’t have known was there. The Kepler space mission began development in 1983 with its main goal being to find other planets. 18 years later it launched on March 9th,  2009. Within this initial launch period it was discovered that the telescope had already discovered 5 exoplanets using the transit method already proving to be a great success. The telescope was originally designed to stay in space for 3 and a half years however with the mission being a huge success NASA decided to keep it in space until eventually on October 30th, 2018 it ran out of fuel and was retired after identifying over  2000 exoplanets.

        The Kepler space telescope used the Transit method to find other exoplanets. This method involved observing stars and waiting to see if the light dimmed due to a planet passing in front of the star. This dimming of the light allows us to tell the orbit and the size of the planet through the frequency of the dimming and the length of duration of it. Despite being used this method has its drawbacks as you could imagine a star is very big whereas the planet would be smaller. This means that the dimming of the light wouldn’t be easy to spot. This meant that the Kepler space telescope had to be equipped with very sensitive cameras to spot this change. Another disadvantage to this method is when observing a planet in a multi star system it is difficult to know what is causing this dip in the light. An example of a planet which was ‘forgotten’ due to this is the KOI-5B planet which exists in a triple star system. David Ciardi, Chief Scientist of NASA’s science institute said ‘KOI-5Ab got abandoned because it was complicated, and we had thousands of candidates’ which implies that this triple-star system caused many issues into this discovery. In 2018 the Transiting exoplanet survey satellite observed the KOI-5B planet and finally showed proof that the planet existed.
