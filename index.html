        The Kepler Space Telescope was a vital piece of technology to allow scientists to observe planets we previously wouldn’t have known was there.
        The Kepler space mission began development in 1983 with its main goal being to find other planets. 18 years later it launched on March 9th, 
        2009. Within this initial launch period it was discovered that the telescope had already discovered 5 exoplanets using the transit method already
        proving to be a great success. The telescope was originally designed to stay in space for 3 and a half years however with the mission being a
        huge success NASA decided to keep it in space until eventually on October 30th, 2018 it ran out of fuel and was retired after identifying over
        2000 exoplanets.
